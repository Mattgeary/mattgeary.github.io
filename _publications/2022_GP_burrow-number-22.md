# Abstract

Phylogenetic analyses can be used to resolve taxonomic uncertainties and reconstruct a species’ evolutionary history. This can be combined with ecological data to predict missing life history traits which are important for creation of conservation management strategies. We investigated the evolutionary and life history of the ‘Critically Endangered’ Grenada Dove _Leptotila wellsi_ by estimating its phylogenetic placement and using this new phylogeny to test the accuracy of phylogenetic comparative methods for estimating both documented and unknown life history traits. We extracted DNA from two Grenada Dove samples and obtained sequences from three mitochondrial markers: Cytochrome oxidase I (COI), NADH dehydrogenase 2 (ND2) and Cytochrome b (Cyt b); and one nuclear marker: β-Fibrinogen intron 7 (β-FIB). We present the first genetic data obtained for the Grenada Dove. Our data identify the Grey-Chested Dove Leptotila cassinii as the species which shares both a most recent common ancestor, with an estimated divergence of approximately 2.53 million years ago, and the smallest genetic distance (P = 0.0303) with the Grenada Dove. Life history trait values for the Grenada Dove predicted from our analyses using phylogenetic imputation are: clutch size = 2 (± 0.09) eggs; clutches per year = 1.4 (± 0.81); incubation time = 14.2 (± 0.75) days; hatching weight = 3.8 g (± 1.05) and single imputation: fledging age (genus median) = 15.5 days, longevity (genus median) = 8.6 years. This study contributes novel information regarding evolutionary history and life history characteristics to inform long-term conservation actions for a ‘Critically Endangered’ species.
