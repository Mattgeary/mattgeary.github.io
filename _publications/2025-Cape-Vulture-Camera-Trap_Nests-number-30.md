# Abstract

The Cape Vulture (Gyps coprotheres) has the smallest range of any vulture species in Africa, Europe or Asia and is substantially impacted by anthropogenic factors because of their low productivity and long maturation times. Almost year-round presence at breeding colonies makes understanding Cape Vulture breeding behaviour essential for their conservation. Camera traps, a first for this species, were used to investigate the effect of time of day and temperature on the presence and behaviours performed at nest sites. The number of vultures at a nest site was likely to be higher during the early morning and late afternoon when temperatures were lower, with significantly fewer individuals present at higher temperatures in the days before and after laying. Attendance of at least one adult at the nest was recorded for 86.9% and 99.8% of time points in the days before and after laying, respectively. Almost-constant attendance during incubation may also be necessitated by predation pressure, with this study providing observation of possible predation pressure by White-necked Ravens (Corvus albicollis) at the colony. Here, we demonstrate that camera trapping is an effective method of studying Cape Vulture breeding behaviour, which improves understanding and allows more informed conservation measures to be implemented. Cape Vulture nest attendance is affected by temperature, so this species may be vulnerable to climatic changes and subsequent changes in predation pressure.
