I am an ecologist with an interest in how and why populations grow spatially and over time. Can these processes be explained through demographics, movements of individuals or, perhaps, environmental drivers? Why do certain species live where they do and how might this change in the future? I use ecological modelling and statistical analyses to try to answer these questions. I am a Senior lecturer in Conservation Biology at the University of Chester and work in the Conservation Biology Research Group. 

<br>

My current research includes conservation projects on birds including projects in the UK (e.g. Capercaillie, Golden Eagle, Tawny Owl), the Canary Islands (e.g. Houbara Bustard) and the Caribbean (e.g. Grenada Dove, Hispaniolan Parakeet). I also work on amphibians and invertebrates (particularly dragonflies) as well as ecological projects on forest landscapes. In the past I have worked on black grouse conservation and vector-borne disease ecology. I am an associate editor at [Bird Study](https://www.bto.org/research-data-services/publications/bird-study).
