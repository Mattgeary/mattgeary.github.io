I am an ecologist with an interest in how and why populations grow spatially and over time. Can these processes be explained through demographics, movements of individuals or, perhaps, environmental drivers? Why do certain species live where they do and how might this change in the future? I use ecological modelling and statistical analyses to try to answer these questions. I am a Senior lecturer in Conservation Biology at the University of Chester and work in the Conservation Biology Research Group. 

<br>

My current research includes conservation projects on birds inlcuding projects in the UK (e.g. Capercaillie, Golden Eagle, Tawny Owl), the Canary Islands (e.g. Houbara Bustard) and the Caribbean (e.g. Grenada Dove, Hispaniolan Parakeet). I also work on amphibians and invertebrates (particularly dragonflies) as well as ecological projects on forest landscapes. In the past I have worked on black grouse conservation and vector-borne disease ecology. I am an associate editor at [Bird Study](https://www.bto.org/research-data-services/publications/bird-study).

<br>

I usually advertise several MRes projects each year as part of our [MRes Biological Sciences](https://www1.chester.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/biological-sciences-mres) programme. If you are interested, take a look at the [details of my projects](http://mattgeary.github.io/MRes/) which will, be posted when confirmed and contact me if you'd like to know more. I also run our [MSc in Wildlife Conservation](https://www1.chester.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/wildlife-conservation).
