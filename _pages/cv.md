## Research


My research focuses on modelling populations in space and time. Currently I am working on using these models to identify vulnerable demographic features, investigate habitat associations and provide evidence-based advice for land managers and conservationists. I have projects involving birds, mammals, invertebrates and amphibians in the Great Britain, Ireland, South East Asia and the Caribbean. I have a keen interest in the use of computational methods in ecology and environmental science and believe that the use of novel computational techniques has the potential to answer many questions in ecology and conservation. I currently supervise several PhD and MRes students working on topics related to conservation biology and ecology. I also have experience as an examiner for PhD qualifications.
