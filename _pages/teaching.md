I currently run two postgraduate programmes (MRes Biological Sciences and MSc Wildlife Conservation) and am the Postgraduate Research Tutor for the department. I previously developed and led two undergraduate programmes (BSc Conservation Biology and BSc Zoology). 

My teaching focuses on ecology, conservation and statistical analysis. I designed and currently lead the following modules
