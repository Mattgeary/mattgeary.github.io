I am Currently the Senior Postgraduate Research Tutor for the Faculty of Science, Business and Enterprise. I previously developed and led two undergraduate programmes (BSc Conservation Biology and BSc Zoology) and two postgraduate programmes (MRes Biological Sciences and MSc Wildlife Conservation). 

My teaching focuses on ecology, conservation and statistical analysis. I designed and currently lead the following modules
