### Aims

This module provides students with an introduction to graduate-level approaches to biodiversity data analysis, and introduce two important software platforms for statistical exploration, simulation and spatial data analysis. The first half of this module uses R to teach data exploration and statistical analysis. The second half of this module introduces geographic information systems and their use in the analysis of spatially-explicit biological data, including raster and vector data.   

### Learning Outcomes

At the end of this module students should be able to:  

* Use the “R” computing environment to design experiments, statistically test and simulate patterns in biological systems  
* Explain and use statistical analysis in the context of conservation biology including simple statistical tests, linear and non-linear regression and ordination.
* Demonstrate an ability to create, manage and manipulate spatial data through the ArcGIS computing platform;
* Transform vector and raster data into biologically relevant information;
* Interpret and manipulate remotely sensed spatially explicit data to elucidate underlying patterns and drivers of biodiversity distributions; 


### Module content

This module provides learners with a graduate-level overview of the following topics in biostatistics, geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing:

* Introduction to the “R” platform
* Basic statistical methods
* Experimental design and exploring biological data
* Advanced statistical methods – GLM and GLMM
* Introduction to spatial dataand its management
* Vector data analysis
* Raster data analysis
* Remote-sensing
