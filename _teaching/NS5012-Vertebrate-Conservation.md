### Aims

This module aims to build on knowledge of taxonomy, ecology and conservation biology in level 4 to provide a detailed exploration of conservation problems for vertebrate taxa. The module builds on students' knowledge of vertebrate taxa and help them to understand the most pertinent threats to the long-term survival of a range of species within these groups. They explore applied conservation problems and become familiar with a range of approaches to conservation. This module aims to provide an introduction to cutting edge conservation research and allows students to build their experience and expertise in subjects and methods used by conservation professionals.  

### Learning Outcomes

At the end of this module students should be able to:  

* Analyse the underlying causes of global biodiversity loss.	
* Combine knowledge of ecological principles and conservation biology to understand the impact and extent of threats to vertebrate taxa.	
* Evaluate and justify the use of conservation management actions depending on the taxa and ecosystem context.	
* Effectively communicate current conservation issues and propose solutions to these problems.
