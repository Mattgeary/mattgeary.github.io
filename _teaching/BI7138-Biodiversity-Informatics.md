### Aims

This module provides students with an introduction to graduate-level approaches to biodiversity data analysis, and introduce two important software platforms for statistical exploration, simulation and spatial data analysis. The first half of this module uses R to teach data exploration and statistical analysis. The second half of this module introduces geographic information systems and their use in the analysis of spatially-explicit biological data, including raster and vector data.   

### Learning Outcomes

At the end of this module students should be able to:  

* Master complex and specialized software and use informed judgement to organise, manipulate and analyse numeric and/or spatial data 
* Systematically deploy knowledge of appropriate statistical and/or spatial methods to justify their use and interpret relevant outputs	
* Critically evaluate the scientific literature to develop appropriate hypotheses which can be analysed using statistical and/or spatial approaches	
* Critically evaluate the results of statistical and/or spatial analyses by producing figures, maps and written work of a professional standard	
* Systematically deploy a wide range of techniques to combine statistical and spatial skills to design, execute and critically evaluate a biologically meaningful spatial analysis project.

### Module content

This module provides learners with a graduate-level overview of the following topics in biostatistics, geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing:

* Introduction to the “R” platform
* Basic statistical methods
* Experimental design and exploring biological data
* Advanced statistical methods – GLM and GLMM
* Introduction to spatial data and its management
* Vector data 
* Raster data 
* Combining spatial and statistical analyses
