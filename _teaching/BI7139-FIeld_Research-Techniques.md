### Aims

This module provides students with an overview of standard field techniques in wildlife research. This includes the process of wildlife research planning, study design and field techniques for estimation of abundance, distribution, behaviour and demographic indices. It also provides training in the ethical issues and risk assessment issues associated with wildlife research.


### Learning Outcomes

At the end of this module students should be able to:  

* Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the range of sampling techniques available for estimating wildlife populations and their demographic parameters, their limitations and application;

* Critically assess the risks, ethical implications and health and safety issues for study animals and research workers associated with wildlife field research;

* Critically assess the utility, limitations and application of techniques for estimating wildlife species diversity, abundance, behaviour, demography and habitat use in wildlife research;

* Design, implement, carry out and report on a field based wildlife research project
